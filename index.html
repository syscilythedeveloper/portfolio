              <p>
                My name is Syscily Brown and I'm a Software Engineer specializing in full-stack development with expertise in React, Next.js, and cloud technologies. In my most recent role, as a software engineer with Microsoft Leap, I modernized front-end architecture and achieved 85% test coverage across metrics. Prior to working in software engineering, I worked in K-12 education for 10 years, which has uniquely equipped me to translate complex technical concepts into clear, accessible language and respond to stakeholder needs with precision. I leverage AI tools like GitHub Copilot to accelerate development cycles and focus on creating innovative, data-driven solutions.

              <h2>Academic Background and Training</h2>
              <p>
                I’m a proud alumna of Howard University, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Human Development. HU! After that, I pursued a Master's in Teaching from Relay Graduate School of Education. This combination of formal education and 10+ years of hands-on teaching experience has helped me become really good at explaining complex topics in a clear and relatable way.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey into software engineering began with a full-stack web development bootcamp. Since then, I've continued my learning through self-driven learning, fellowships, and freelance work.

              </p>
              <p>
                
                To document this journey, I've created technical blog. After a decade in education, I believe that the best way to understand a topic is to explain it clearly to others. Through my blog, I aim to break down complex ideas and share my experiences as I grow and evolve in this field. Join me as I explore and explain both complex practical and technical concepts in the ever-evolving world of technology!

              <p>
                I always have a hard time answering, "What do you do for fun?"
                because the real answer is a little bit of everything. I’m an
                avid traveler and a multi-sport athlete with a love for math and
                science. I also enjoy painting and am a huge fan of cooking
                shows and cooking. Recently, I got a KitchenAid and have really
                gotten into making pasta and pastries from scratch—I don’t think
                I’ll ever buy store-bought noodles again! In the
                picture, you can see my first homemade puff pastry for a Salmon
                Wellington. Gordon Ramsay, I hope I made you proud!

          <p>
            <p>
              I’m skilled in both frontend and backend technologies, with hands-on experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, Node.js, and AWS.  I have experience building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) apps, integrating advanced data retrieval and generation features. I also enjoy crafting user interfaces with tools like Bootstrap and Material-UI. My background in data analysis and STEM education has sharpened my problem-solving and collaboration skills. Always eager to learn and improve, I apply these skills to achieve meaningful results in my projects and roles.
