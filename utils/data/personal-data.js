    "My name is Syscily Brown and I'm a lifelong learner who taught myself how to code. I excel at building AI-powered applications using React and TypeScript, and I love creating solutions that truly serve their intended audience. What makes me different? Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was an elementary school teacher and Mathematics Program Manager. My superpower is making complex topics easy for anyone to understand. The same skills that drove 119% improvement in student performance—understanding user needs, analyzing data, and explaining complex concepts—are what make me an effective developer who can tackle technical challenges and collaborate seamlessly with cross-functional teams.",
